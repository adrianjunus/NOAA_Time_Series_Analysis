# Twista

This is a batch script I wrote a long time ago, when I was in school and heavily involved in a lot of oceaonography projects, but not in the capacity of analysis like I wanted to be (I was a Mechanical Engineer student). Toward the end of my degree I started hedging my bets toward data programming so took an introductory course with a great professor at UW. The goal of this was to (make an attempt) to test a grand hypothesis: Can NOAA buoy metrics be utilized to anticipate inclement weather? (Not that this isn't already calculated by satellites). I was told this was a bold endeavor and indeed it was! 

This repo includes:
- A batch script that can run against some NOAA buoy data
- Snippets of the mentioned buoy data
- The calculated mean-square errors (supposing to represent how closely I could identify storms, with a 0 error being perfect and honestly anything higher meant results were wildly inaccurate)
- A powerpoint loosely aggregating the results (a lot of text was left out so I could practice public speaking on the fly)

Enjoy!
